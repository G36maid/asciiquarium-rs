## Notes

- Keep compatibility with original Perl version behavior
- Maintain ASCII art authenticity from original
- Focus on performance and smooth animation
- Ensure graceful handling of various terminal sizes
- Preserve the meditative, relaxing nature of the original

### Priority Next Steps
1. **Water Surface Animation** - Implement animated tileable water waves at top
2. **Fix Color Mapping** - Make fish colors match original color mask system
3. **Add Seaweed System** - Swaying seaweed plants at bottom
4. **Add More Fish Species** - Port remaining fish designs from original
5. **Castle Background** - Add the castle decoration at bottom-right
