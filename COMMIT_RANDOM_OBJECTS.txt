Fix and verify all random objects against original Perl implementation

This commit completes a comprehensive verification of all 5 random objects
(large creatures) against the original asciiquarium.pl code and fixes all
discrepancies found.

## Issues Fixed

### Big Fish (High Priority)
- **Depth**: Corrected from 3 (FISH_START) to 2 (SHARK depth)
  - Original Perl uses $depth{'shark'} (value 2)
  - Affects rendering order and visual appearance

- **Spawn Positions**: Fixed X coordinates to match original exactly
  - Variant1: -34 (right) or width-1 (left), was: 1-sprite_width / width-2
  - Variant2: -33 (right) or width-1 (left), was: 1-sprite_width / width-2

- **Y Position Ranges**: Now varies by variant height
  - Variant1 (14 lines): Uses height-15 constraint
  - Variant2 (13 lines): Uses height-14 constraint

- **Variant Selection**: Adjusted to match original logic exactly
  - Changed comparison from `> 0` to `> 1`
  - Matches original `int(rand(3)) > 1`

### Sea Monster (Medium Priority)
- **Classic Mode Support**: Implemented old/classic monster sprites
  - Added 4-frame old monster sprites from add_old_monster()
  - Classic mode: 4 frames, spawns at x=-64
  - Modern mode: 2 frames, spawns at x=-54
  - Added classic_mode parameter to SeaMonster::new()
  - Updated spawner to pass classic_mode flag

## Verification Results

All 5 random objects verified correct:
- ✅ Ship: Speed 1, depth 7, spawn x=-24/width-2, y=0
- ✅ Whale: Speed 1, depth 5, spawn x=-18/width-2, y=0, 12-frame animation
- ✅ Sea Monster: Speed 2, depth 5, spawn x=-54/-64, y=2, mode-based frames
- ✅ Big Fish: Speed 3/2.5, depth 2, spawn x=-34/-33, variant-based Y
- ✅ Shark: Speed 2, depth 2, spawn x=-53/width-2, teeth mechanics

## Testing

- Added 2 new tests for Sea Monster classic mode
- Added 5 new tests for Big Fish (depth, spawn positions, Y ranges)
- Updated existing tests to verify corrected behavior
- All 71 tests passing (up from 66)
- Zero clippy warnings

## Documentation

- Created RANDOM_OBJECTS_VERIFICATION.md: Detailed verification report
- Created FIXES_NEEDED.md: List of required fixes (reference)
- Created RANDOM_OBJECTS_FIXES_COMPLETE.md: Complete summary
- Updated TODO.md: Marked random objects verification complete
- Updated CHANGELOG.md: Documented all fixes

## Files Modified

- src/entities/big_fish.rs: Fixed depth, spawn positions, Y ranges
- src/entities/sea_monster.rs: Added classic mode, old monster sprites
- src/spawning.rs: Updated sea_monster spawner to pass classic_mode

Fixes ensure the Rust port matches the original Perl implementation exactly
for all large creature spawning, movement, and behavior.
